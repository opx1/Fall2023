The modeling went pretty well until it came to modeling the whiskers 
and the fins, I wanted to switch between moving and adding but they 
were such small geomotry that the faces kept getting super messed up 
and it I had to over expand them and then squish them down to the shape 
I wanted

Retopoing took a while as expected but I think I did pretty good!
The biggest part that needed fixed was the eye socket as it spun around
is a spiral, but it was a pain to figure out something cleaner, I think
it worked out though. I also cleaned up the connections to the fins,
the ends of the whiskers were a nightmare of polys, and then I added eyes.
I then brough it back into zbrush to mold the shape a little more to what
I wanted and closed the mouth.
